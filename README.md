# Scrapy testing 
**cd into tutorial directory**: ['scrapy crawl quotes']
## :thought_balloon:learning scrapy
goal of this project is to learn as much as i can about this library and seeing advantages over libraries I already know like beautifulsoup 
## CONCLUSION
- easy to parase and save files
- hard to set up proxies and proxy rotation 
- proxy rotation is SLOW
- proxy and proxy rotation breaks on multi process mode

being able to work with proxies is important for me. I don't think i'll be using this
